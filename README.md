# production-timer

## Introduction

This app is a productivity app built to make it easier to build habits and be more productive. For now I'll create a countdown for two categories: work and free time.  

## Branches

This project has two branches:  
- master: this branch is the branch where the finished and tested features will be pushed, no commits should be done in this branch.  
- dev: the development branch where new features will be first implemented and tested.  

## How to install the project

	python3 -m venv venv
	pip install -r requirements.txt
